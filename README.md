# smallPythonScrips

Just random scripts for different applications. No offense - just curiousity

khabarOnline.py -> tracks the number of people online
speechMain.py -> speech recognition algorithm
speakerBot.py -> simple script for chat. Credits to wwdialogflow-python-client
reqCode.py -> script for extracting HTML code of web site. I want to search for input fields for future exploitation.
simpleLoginNU.py -> my old script for login into my.nu.edu.kz system using login credentials
